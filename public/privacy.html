  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <span class="legal-date">Last updated: February 24, 2026</span>

  <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") governs the manner in which AI bloop ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, processes, stores, and discloses information obtained from users ("User," "you," or "your") of our website, applications, AI chatbot services, APIs, and any affiliated platforms (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or utilizing the Services, you irrevocably acknowledge that you have read, comprehended, and consent to be bound by this Policy in its entirety. If you do not agree to the terms herein, you must immediately discontinue all use of the Services.</p>

  <h2>1. Scope of Information Collection</h2>
  <p>We may collect information that you voluntarily provide, including but not limited to your full legal name, email address, company or organization name, billing and payment information, telephone number, and any other data submitted through forms, communications, account registration, or chatbot interactions. We additionally collect technical and usage data automatically, including without limitation: IP addresses, browser type and version, device identifiers, operating system, referring and exit URLs, access timestamps, pages and features viewed, clickstream data, interaction patterns, and session duration, through the use of cookies, web beacons, pixels, local storage objects, and analogous tracking technologies. <strong>We expressly disclaim any obligation to collect only the minimum data necessary</strong> and reserve the unilateral right to collect any information reasonably related to the operation, improvement, analytics, or monetization of our Services.</p>

  <h2>2. Purposes of Data Use</h2>
  <p>Information collected may be used for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to: (a) provisioning, operating, maintaining, and enhancing the Services; (b) processing commercial transactions and transmitting related correspondence; (c) disseminating promotional materials, newsletters, product updates, and marketing communications; (d) conducting analytics, statistical analysis, research, and product development; (e) training, improving, and refining our AI models, algorithms, and machine learning systems; (f) detecting, investigating, preventing, and addressing fraud, unauthorized access, security breaches, or technical anomalies; (g) complying with applicable legal and regulatory obligations and enforcing our contractual rights; and (h) any other purpose disclosed at the point of collection or to which you subsequently provide consent. We reserve the unilateral right to modify or expand the purposes for which data is processed without prior notification, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing, Disclosure, and Third-Party Recipients</h2>
  <p>We may share, transfer, or otherwise disclose your information to third-party service providers, technology partners, hosting providers, payment processors, analytics vendors, business affiliates, subsidiaries, and successors-in-interest who assist in operating, analyzing, securing, or improving our Services. We may additionally disclose information: (a) in response to lawful requests, subpoenas, court orders, or other compulsory legal process by public authorities, including to satisfy national security, regulatory, or law enforcement requirements; (b) to protect and defend our rights, property, safety, or that of our users, the public, or any third party; (c) in connection with any merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, divestiture, asset sale, financing, or bankruptcy proceeding, whether actual or contemplated; or (d) with your express or implied consent. <strong>We shall bear no liability whatsoever for the privacy practices, data handling, or security measures of any third party to whom data is lawfully disclosed or transferred.</strong></p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Preservation</h2>
  <p>We retain personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, satisfy our legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Following termination or deactivation of your account, we reserve the right to retain de-identified, aggregated, pseudonymized, or anonymized data indefinitely and without restriction for analytical, research, and product improvement purposes. <strong>We expressly disclaim any obligation to delete, purge, or return data upon request except where mandatorily required by applicable and enforceable law in your jurisdiction of residence.</strong></p>

  <h2>5. Cookies, Tracking Technologies, and Automated Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The Services deploy cookies, persistent and session-based local storage objects, web beacons, tracking pixels, software development kits (SDKs), and similar technologies for functional, analytical, performance, and advertising purposes. By continuing to access or use the Services, you consent to the deployment and operation of such technologies on your device. You may configure your browser or device settings to reject or limit cookies; however, doing so may materially impair the functionality, performance, and accessibility of certain features of the Services, for which impairment we bear no responsibility or liability.</p>

  <h2>6. Security Measures</h2>
  <p>We implement commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction, including encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, and monitoring systems. <strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing, no method of electronic transmission, storage, or processing is absolutely secure. We expressly disclaim any warranty, guarantee, or representation, whether express or implied, that your information will remain inviolate, uncompromised, or free from unauthorized access.</strong> You acknowledge and voluntarily accept the inherent and unavoidable risks associated with transmitting information over the internet and electronic networks and agree that we shall not be liable for any unauthorized access, data breach, interception, or security incident except to the extent directly and proximately caused by our gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Services are not directed to, designed for, or intended to be used by individuals under the age of eighteen (18). We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from minors. If we obtain actual knowledge that personal information has been collected from a minor without verifiable parental or guardian consent, we will take commercially reasonable steps to delete such information expeditiously.</p>

  <h2>8. International and Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in jurisdictions other than your country of residence, including the United States and other jurisdictions that may not provide an equivalent or adequate level of data protection under your local laws. By using the Services, you expressly and unambiguously consent to such international transfers and processing. <strong>We disclaim all liability arising from or related to the data protection laws, enforcement practices, or regulatory frameworks of any foreign jurisdiction to which data may be transferred.</strong></p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>Depending upon your jurisdiction of residence, you may possess certain statutory rights regarding your personal information, which may include the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, object to processing, or request portability of your data, subject to applicable legal exceptions and limitations. To exercise any such rights, you must submit a verifiable written request to the contact address provided below. We reserve the right to verify your identity through reasonable authentication procedures before processing any request and may impose a reasonable administrative fee for requests that are manifestly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive as determined in our sole discretion. <strong>We shall respond to verified requests within the timeframes prescribed by applicable law, but expressly disclaim liability for any delay, incompleteness, or inability to comply caused by factors beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to technical limitations, third-party dependencies, and conflicting legal obligations.</strong></p>

  <h2>10. Modifications to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We reserve the sole, absolute, and unfettered right to amend, modify, supplement, restate, or replace this Policy at any time and from time to time, in our exclusive discretion and without prior notice. All modifications become effective immediately upon posting to the Services. Your continued use of the Services following any modification constitutes your binding, irrevocable acceptance of the revised Policy. It is your sole responsibility to review this Policy periodically for changes.</p>
